# ParseClientData
Read client data for processing

Provide a program that reads a CSV file and outputs two text files. The first should show the frequency of the first and
last names ordered by frequency descending and then alphabetically ascending.

E.g.
Smith, 4
Jones, 3
Martin, 3
Brown, 1

The second should show the addresses sorted alphabetically by street name.

E.g.
12 Acton St
31 Clifton Rd
22 Jones Rd

So ordered by frequency first (descending) and then alphabetically (ascending).

E.g
For the list of names:
Matt Brown
Heinrich Jones
Johnson Smith
Tim Johnson

E.g
The first list should be:
Johnson, 2
Brown, 1
Heinrich, 1
Jones, 1
Matt, 1
Smith, 1
Tim, 1

As mentioned can you also include a unit test project using which ever unit testing framework youâ€™re most comfortable with.
